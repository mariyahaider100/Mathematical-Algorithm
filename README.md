This repository is both a learning space and a reference hub for the course Mathematical Algorithms.

Its purpose is to support students and enthusiasts in exploring, implementing, and experimenting with key algorithms that form the foundation of mathematics and computer science. Inside, youâ€™ll find well-documented code examples, clear explanations, and problem-solving approaches that align with the topics taught in the Mathematical Algorithms course.

**Course Lecturer:** Osman Torunoglu

Each weekly exercise provides:

1.MATLAB codes

2.Accompanying README.md documentation

3.Plots and visualizations
