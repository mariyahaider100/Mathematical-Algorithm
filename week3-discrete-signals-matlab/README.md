# Short description of each Discrete Singal


#### 1. Unit Impulse Signal

The unit impulse signal has value ``1`` only at ``n = 0`` and 0 everywhere else. I use it to test how a system responds to a sudden input. You can think of it as a digital "spark."

#### 2. Unit Step Signal

The unit step signal is ``0`` for negative time and ``1`` for ``n >= 0``.
I use it to represent switching behavior, like when a system turns ON. You can use it to model sudden changes.

#### 3. Ramp Signal

The discrete ramp signal increases linearly with time.
I learned that it is useful to model steady growth or gradual increase in systems. We often use it for control and testing.

#### 4. Exponential Signal

The exponential signal either grows or decays depending on the base value.
I understand it as a model for charging, discharging, or population growth. You will often see it in natural and digital systems.

#### 5. Signum Signal

The signum signal shows the sign of ``n``.
It is ``-1`` for negative values of ``n``.
It is ``0`` when ``n = 0``.
It is ``+1`` for positive values of ``n``.
I use it to show direction changes. You can think of it like a digital "compass" that only tells you if you are below zero, at zero, or above zero.

#### 6. Sinc Signal

The sinusoidal signal oscillates up and down between positive and negative values.
We see it in communication, sound waves, and many control systems. I find it interesting because almost every repeating process in nature can be represented with sinusoids.
